        "tldr":"Microsoft partners will start shipping a new Copilot key on a variety of new PCs and laptops. The button will provide quick access to Microsoft's AI-powered Windows Copilot experience. It is the first big change to the Windows PC keyboard layout in nearly three decades. The new Copilot key will replace the menu (or application) key. If Windows Copilot isn't available in the user's country, the button will launch Windows Search instead. It is unclear whether Microsoft plans to allow users to use the key in combination with other keys.",

It appears to be powered by Gemini Ultra, an upgrade over the current version of Bard which runs the mid-tier Gemini Pro. There may be a feature that allows users to create custom bots, but it is unclear whether users will be able to share these bots. It is unknown when or if the feature will become official.","date":"2024-01-05","category":"big","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":352858,"url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24025535/google-ai-robot-constitution-autort-deepmind-three-laws?utm_source=tldrnewsletter","title":"Google wrote a ‚ÄòRobot Constitution‚Äô to make sure its new AI droids won‚Äôt kill us (3 minute read)","tldr":"The DeepMind robotics team has revealed three new advances that will help robots make faster, better, and safer decisions in the wild. One involves a system for gathering training data with a set of safety-focused prompts instructing the model to avoid choosing tasks that involve humans, animals, sharp objects, and electrical appliances. The others are a neural network architecture designed to make the existing Robotic Transformer RT-2 more accurate and faster and RT-Trajectory, which adds 2D outlines to help robots better perform specific physical tasks.","date":"2024-01-05","category":"future","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":352859,"url":"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/01/elon-musk-spacex-needs-to-build-starships-as-often-as-boeing-builds-737s/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter","title":"Elon Musk: SpaceX needs to build Starships as often as Boeing builds 737s (5 minute read)","tldr":"Elon Musk recently made a post on X saying that SpaceX might need to make up to 300 spaceships a year to achieve Mars colonization. Establishing a settlement on Mars will require rocket travel to be nearly as routine as air travel. While SpaceX will be able to reuse Starship and its Super Heavy boosters, the parts that travel into orbit won't be able to be reused as often. Ships often have to orbit the planet several times before they line up with pickup sites, so they might only be able to be used once a day.","date":"2024-01-05","category":"future","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":352861,"url":"https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/terminal-smooth-scrolling","title":"Terminal smooth scrolling (5 minute read)","tldr":"Terminal usually draws lines of text at fixed intervals. When scrolling, the sudden jumps are incompatible with how eyes track motion, making it a blurry mess that's hard to read. This blog post discusses how to implement smooth scrolling in Terminal. While smooth scrolling uses a lot more resources, it makes it possible to easily skim text as it scrolls by. A video demonstrating the difference between normal scrolling and smooth scrolling in Terminal is available in the post.","date":"2024-01-05","category":"programming","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":352863,"url":"https://mise.jdx.dev/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter","title":"mise-en-place (Website)","tldr":"mise-en-place manages dev tools like Node, Python, CMake, Terraform, and more.

Developers will have to review OpenAI's updated usage policies and GPT brand guidelines as well as verify their user profiles before they will be eligible for listing in the store. Making a bot doesn't require any coding experience - developers can just type the capabilities they want their bots to offer in plain language and a GPT-building tool will attempt to make it. Bots can be as simple or complex as a developer wishes. It is unclear whether the GPT Store will launch with a revenue-sharing scheme.","date":"2024-01-05","category":"miscellaneous","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":352868,"url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24025409/openai-training-data-lowball-nyt-ai-copyright?utm_source=tldrnewsletter","title":"OpenAI‚Äôs news publisher deals reportedly top out at $5 million a year (2 minute read)","tldr":"OpenAI offers between $1 million and $5 million a year to license copyrighted news articles to train its AI models.","date":"2024-01-05","category":"quick","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":352870,"url":"https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/random_transformer/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter","title":"The Random Transformer (44 minute read)","tldr":"This blog post provides an end-to-end example of the math within a transformer model with lots of simplification and reduced dimensions.","date":"2024-01-05","category":"quick","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":352872,"url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-super-refresh-confirmed-for-ces-2024?utm_source=tldrnewsletter","title":"Nvidia Super refresh confirmed for CES 2024 ‚Äî Gigabyte teases GeForce RTX 40-series Super GPUs (2 minute read)","tldr":"It is likely that Gigabyte's Aorus Turkey graphics board will essentially confirm Nvidia's RTX 40 Super launch.","date":"2024-01-05","category":"quick","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":352874,"url":"https://electrek.co/2024/01/04/tesla-adds-powerwall-solar-charger-api-devs/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter","title":"Tesla adds Powerwall, solar, and charger to its API for devs (2 minute read)","tldr":"The release is aimed at increasing the value of Tesla's distributed energy assets and growing the deployment of its energy storage products.","date":"2024-01-05","category":"quick","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":352876,"url":"https://socket.dev/blog/when-everything-becomes-too-much?utm_source=tldrnewsletter","title":"When \"Everything\" Becomes Too Much: The npm Package Chaos of 2024 (5 minute read)","tldr":"An npm package called 'everything' released in the new year that depended on every other public npm package, creating millions of transitive dependencies, caused storage space to run out and system resource exhaustion for anyone that installed it.","date":"2024-01-05","category":"quick","newsletter":"tech"},{"id":352878,"url":"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/section-174/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter","title":"The Pulse: Will US companies hire fewer engineers due to Section 174?
